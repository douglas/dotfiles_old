Hey,

This is a fork of mitsuhiko dotfiles that suit my needs (thanks Armin).
As he said, they might not work for you, but feel free to steal from them.

You will also need his vcprompt branch if you want to use the
bash prompt: https://bitbucket.org/mitsuhiko/vcprompt

This is what it looks like: http://plixi.com/p/46381749

If you want fancy colors in the Terminal, you will need the SIMBL
plugin (http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) as well
as the TerminalColors plugin.  Armin has a fork of it on github that
is configured to compile for 32bit and 64bit and works for Snow
Leopard (http://github.com/mitsuhiko/terminalcolours).

OR

You can use iTerm2, that already has support for everything =)
